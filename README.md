C# Class (complete with overloaded comparison operators) for Paper Rock Scissors Lizard Spock

* Scissors cut paper
* Paper covers rock
* Rock crushes lizard
* Lizard poisons Spock
* Spock smashes scissors
* Scissors decapitate lizard
* Lizard eats paper
* Paper disproves Spock
* Spock vaporizes rock

I created this as an excuse to implement operator overloads in C# for fun and practice.
